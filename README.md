# Thanks Translate
Vandie Studios Ltd makes use of this library to translate Thanks™ to a range of languages. We decided it would makes more sense to open source it and allow our users to help ensure that the system made sense in their language also. For that reason, we offer Thanks Translate.

## Translator Considerations

### Structure
There may be occasions were the correct structure is not possile due to how we've set up our parser, in these occasions, open a second issue for the proposed structure requirment (separate from any pull request or language request issue) and ensure your strings fit your own specification. We'll do our best to try and solve it as long as you do this for us.

### Gender neutrality in languages with grammatical gender
Thanks™ does not store the gender of any of it's members. As such, it's important to us that were possible you use the most gender nuatral version of any phrase (Even if it sounds a little strange considering the language). This is to ensure that no users feel uncomfortable with how they being refered. A wiki page on the use of gender neutrality in languages with gramatical gender can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_neutrality_in_languages_with_grammatical_gender).
